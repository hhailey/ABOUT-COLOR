    <p><strong>Electromagnetic radiation</strong> is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and its intensity.
      When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive,
      approximately from 390 nm to 700 nm), <strong><u>it is known as "visible light".</u></strong></p>
